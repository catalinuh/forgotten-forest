          <p>
            In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, a young Nuyorican named
            Domenico Borrero Celli and a wise old farmer named Israel Gonzalez
            Hernandez discover heirloom coffee varietals, including Typica 401,
            growing wild in a Forgotten Forest.

            They hatch a vision to re-populate shaded Puerto Rican micro-lots
            with specialty varietals and re-claim the glory of Puerto Rican
            coffee.

            We sit in the Cordillera of the Puerto Rican Highlands, where the

            Forest, creating a lush tropical microclimate, allowing Typica 401
            and other heirloom plants to thrive.

            In collaboration with the Peter Alfond foundation, Technoserve, and

          <h4>Flavor Unique to Puerto Rico</h4>
          <p>
            Forgotten Forest coffee traces its genetic link to the early 1800s
            and the first coffee brought from Yemen to the Caribbean. The unique
            Puerto Rican highland microclimate creates a natural mutation that
            produces an elevated and original profile distinguished by its ripe
            tropical fruit notes, velvety mouthfeel, harmonious acidity, and
            deep, resonant finish.
